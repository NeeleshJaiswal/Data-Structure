# Array
An array is fundamentally a list of similar values
store values of same type

Usually array have 3 attributes

# Name
used to reference and interact with it

# Type

what type of information is stored or will be stored within that array
HAS to hold the same type of information

# Size

array's size is a set integer that is fixed upon creation of the array
size cannot be changed

# Accessing Time complexity
O(1)
 
# Searching Time complexity (worst scenario)
O(n)

# Accessing Time complexity (worst scenario)
O(n)

# Accessing Time complexity (worst scenario)
O(n)

# Pro & Cons
Good for storing similar dat
O(1) accessing power

Size of array cannot be changed
Inserting and Deleting are not efficient
Can be wasting storage space (if array have size 10 and only 2 places are filled it will take place of 10 elements)

# Arraylist is an advance version of array
have lot of similar functionalities
Arraylist always use the array in backend
